EC327 Final Project (Pixel Pet)

Our Github is organized into Project Documentation, testTesting (the Source code), and Miscillaneous files. We decided to keep the original project documentation outside of the folders to show the Wednesday timestamp. Please note changes to these files are to reflect the development of our project.
